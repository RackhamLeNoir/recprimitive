# Crec and Trec

Interpreters for the Primitive Recursion language. Crec is based on combinators and Trec on Martin LÃ¶f's terms.

# Primitive Recursion

Primitive recursion is a simple language, which only uses
* numerals: 0 is a numeral, and if n is a numeral, Succ n is  a numeral too (successor).
* variables
* Recursion on *one* variable. If this variable is 0, then the recursion gives b. Else the variable is the successor of a numeral n, and the result depends on n, and the recursive call on n.
